# APS Project  
Introduction:  

Plagiarism & Spam Checker is a project designed to mainly check the “common content” between the Content stored  and the content submitted by the user.
It also lists out the Spam/Inappropriate words from the submitted work.  

Objective:  

Basically, the code would be programmed in such a way that it is able to analyse the whole content and tell the users how much content of theirs is plagiarised or is taken from someone else’s work or simply lacks originality.  
There will be a Local Database created for the working of this code. This Database would contain the content which would be used for checking the plagiarism for the content that the user would provide to us.  

The user would be asked for the input of their content. When the user has given his content as an input, this is where programme comes into working. The programme would analyse the content and would tell us, in terms of percentage, that how much of the data is Plagiarised of the user.  

The code is also programmed in such a way that it is able to identify and print all the Spam or Inappropriate words that has been entered by the user.
These words would also be stored in some local Database, for the code to identify it as an Inappropriate word
